# Inventory Management System

## Introduction

This project is an Inventory Management System developed using Python. It aims to help small businesses effectively track and manage their inventory levels and sales data.

## Features

* **Data Setup:**  Stores inventory details in a CSV file, including Item ID, Name, Category, Quantity, Unit Price, and Reorder Level. A separate CSV file can be used for sales transactions (Transaction ID, Item ID, Quantity Sold, Sale Date, Total Price).
* **Managing Inventory:**  Allows users to add new items, update existing item details (e.g., price or quantity), and delete items.
* **Tracking Stock Levels:**  Monitors inventory, lists items running low based on reorder levels, generates reports of out-of-stock items, and provides alerts when stock falls below reorder levels.
* **Sales Recording:**  Records sales, updates inventory quantities based on sales, calculates total sales price for each transaction, and can generate sales reports (e.g., total sales for a specific period).
* **Inventory Analysis:**  Analyzes trends to identify fast-moving and slow-moving items, calculates revenue generated by each category, and generates summary reports (e.g., total stock value, total revenue, and profit).
* **Advanced Features:**
    * **File Handling:** Saves updates to inventory and sales records, exports stock reports to a new CSV file.
    * **Error Handling:** Handles invalid inputs, such as negative quantities or duplicate Item IDs.
    * **Search and Filter:**  Allows searching for items by name, category, or ID, and filtering items by stock status (e.g., low stock, out of stock).
* **User Interface:** Provides an interactive, menu-driven program using `ipywidgets` to manage inventory, record sales transactions, and view stock and sales analysis.
