# Inventory Management System

## Introduction

This project is an Inventory Management System developed using Python. It aims to help small businesses effectively track and manage their inventory levels and sales data.

## Features

* **Data Setup:**  Stores inventory details in a CSV file, including Item ID, Name, Category, Quantity, Unit Price, and Reorder Level. A separate CSV file can be used for sales transactions (Transaction ID, Item ID, Quantity Sold, Sale Date, Total Price).
* **Managing Inventory:**  Allows users to add new items, update existing item details (e.g., price or quantity), and delete items.
* **Tracking Stock Levels:**  Monitors inventory, lists items running low based on reorder levels, generates reports of out-of-stock items, and provides alerts when stock falls below reorder levels.
* **Sales Recording:**  Records sales, updates inventory quantities based on sales, calculates total sales price for each transaction, and can generate sales reports (e.g., total sales for a specific period).
* **Inventory Analysis:**  Analyzes trends to identify fast-moving and slow-moving items, calculates revenue generated by each category, and generates summary reports (e.g., total stock value, total revenue, and profit).
* **Advanced Features:**
    * **File Handling:** Saves updates to inventory and sales records, exports stock reports to a new CSV file.
    * **Error Handling:** Handles invalid inputs, such as negative quantities or duplicate Item IDs.
    * **Search and Filter:**  Allows searching for items by name, category, or ID, and filtering items by stock status (e.g., low stock, out of stock).
* **User Interface:** Provides an interactive, menu-driven program using `ipywidgets` to manage inventory, record sales transactions, and view stock and sales analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file and list your project's dependencies).
3. **Run the Notebook:** Open the `Inventory_Management_System.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
4. **Follow the Menu:** Use the interactive menu to navigate and perform different actions.

## Functions

This inventory management system utilizes several functions to perform various operations. Below is a brief explanation of each key function:

**Inventory Management**

* `add_item()`: Adds a new item to the inventory. Requires item details like ID, name, category, quantity, unit price, and reorder level as input. This function appends the new item as a row in the inventory CSV file.
* `update_item()`: Updates the details of an existing item. Takes the item ID, the field to update (e.g., price or quantity), and the new value as input. It locates the item in the inventory and modifies the specified field.
* `delete_item()`: Removes an item from the inventory based on its ID. This function deletes the corresponding row from the inventory CSV file.

**Stock Tracking**

* `list_low_stock_items()`: Identifies items running low on stock by comparing their current quantity to their reorder level. It generates a list of these items, which can be used to trigger restocking alerts.
* `generate_out_of_stock_report()`: Creates a report of all items that are currently out of stock (quantity = 0). This report helps in identifying items that need immediate attention.
* `alert_low_stock()`: Sends an alert when an item's stock falls below its reorder level. This notification helps in timely restocking and prevents stockouts.

**Sales and Reporting**

* `record_sale()`: Records a sale transaction. Takes the transaction ID, item ID, and quantity sold as input. It updates the inventory quantity accordingly and calculates the total sale price.
* `generate_sales_reports()`: Generates various sales reports, such as total sales for a specific period or top-selling items. This function would typically involve filtering sales data and calculating relevant metrics.

**Inventory Analysis**

* `analyze_trends()`: Analyzes inventory trends to identify fast-moving and slow-moving items. It also calculates the revenue generated by each product category.
* `generate_summary_reports()`: Creates summary reports providing an overview of the inventory status, including total stock value, total revenue, and estimated profit.

**Advanced Features (File Handling, Error Handling, Search, and Filter)**

The code also includes functions for managing files (saving inventory data, exporting reports), handling invalid input (negative quantities, duplicate item IDs), and providing search and filter functionalities to easily navigate and work with the inventory data.


**Usage**

* **Menu-Driven Interface:** The program provides a user-friendly menu to interact with the system. You can choose options like "Manage Inventory," "Record Sales Transaction," "View Analysis," and "Exit."
